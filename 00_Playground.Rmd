## R Markdown

This is a playground for Andrew to mess around with data and learn R and the tidyverse and for simon to learn to type.OVERPASSER!

# Bring in spatial use the sf package
```{r cars}
wrs <- st_read('data/in/wrs2_asc_desc.shp')

wrs %>% 
  sample_frac(.2) %>%
  mapview(., zcol = 'PATH')

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}



```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
